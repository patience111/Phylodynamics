    Leo A. Featherstone, Joshua M. Zhang, Timothy G. Vaughan, Sebastian Duchene (02 June 2022)

    **Key words:** phylogenetics, epidemiology, statistical inference, epidemiology models (infected population size), evolutionary models  (pathogen population size), phylodynamics (output parameters -> epidemiological interpretation)

    > ⭐ **One sentence definition:** phylodynamics combines ==evolutionary biology== and ==epidemiology== to generate ==evidence== about the ==spread== and ==source== of pathogens by exploring the ==genomic signature== left by ongoing evolution during transmission.
