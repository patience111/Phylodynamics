    **Key words:** phylogenetics, epidemiology, statistical inference, epidemiology models (infected population size), evolutionary models  (pathogen population size), phylodynamics (output parameters -> epidemiological interpretation)

    > ⭐ **One sentence definition:** phylodynamics combines *evolutionary biology* and *epidemiology* to generate *evidence* about the *spread* and *source* of pathogens by exploring the *genomic signature* left by ongoing evolution during transmission. 

   ⭐ **Measurable evolution:** pathogen molecular evolution occurs on the same timescale as transmission.

   - SIR model

      - Consider a population size of N and partitions it into susceptible, infected, and removed compartments, haveing size S(t), I(t), and R(t), at time t, respectively.
      - The SIR Population is constrained to obey **S(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N**, meaning it is a closed population with no migration in or out.
